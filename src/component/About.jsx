          A meme token with a deadly sense of humor. <br />
          Deflationary by nature like real nuukes, there are only so many to go around. Fueled by memes, panic, and pure internet degeneracy.

          <strong>NUUKE Token</strong> is not just a coinâ€”it is a statement: when the world melts down, memes will be the last currency standing.
